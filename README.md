# Animal Conservation Mosaic Plot

A mosaic plot visualization of selected animals by class who are under the endangered, critical, or vulnerable conservation status. The visualization required web scraping to gather datasets and converted to a JSON file.

### Features and Skills
- Regular Expressions (re) module to clean up data not needed for analysis that were scraped via BeautifulSoup module
- Statsmodels mosaic module to create the mosaic plot
- Data based on a JSON file that was converted via web scraping

### Notes
Web scraping was a little difficult because I have to remember the classes, methods, and functions that were used for this method. However, I had fun with making mosaic plots and would like to experiment more.
